# Sebastian Custom Shipping method for WooCommerce

## What is it and why?

Sebastian Custom Shipping adds new shipping method that is strictly dependent on shipping classes defined in WooCommerce. This feature is not available with standard WooCommerc shipping methods.

As an example, shop admin can define shipping class for "letter size items" and wishes to have shipping method that is available for orders that contain only items that can fit in letter. With Sebastian Custom Shipping this can be achieved.
